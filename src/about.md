Hello, my name is Hexakis some people also refer to me as "Hex" on the internet.

I'm a hobbyist programmer pursuing a career in Chemical Engineering
which loves unix, rust, go, elixir and vim. I ingage in topics like reverse engineering, microprocessors, binary analysis, networking, cryptography and sometimes pentesting.

I also love reading books and some of my favorite ones are: "Practical Reverse Engineering", "Rootkits and Bootkits", "Attacking Network Protocols", "Hash Crack", "How Linux Works", "A History of Western Philosophy", "1984", "Animal Farm", "Fahrenheit 451", "Cultuurmarxisme" and "Homo Deus"
